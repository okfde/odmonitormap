# Open Data Monitor website
This is the HTML and Javascript for http://www.open-data-map.de/. There is also a Python script to download the data from Google Sheets. As much processing should be done here as possible to keep the heavy Javascript lifting to a minimum. The entire site is (currently) client based - all data is loaded into the browser and processed there.
